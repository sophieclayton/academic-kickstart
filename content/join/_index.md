## Undergraduate students

I will host students through organized programs at ODU, such as the [LEAP Work-Study Program](https://www.odu.edu/tuition-aid/financial-aid/undergraduate/work-study). 

## Graduate students

If you are interested in physical oceanography, ocean biogeochemistry and phytoplankton ecology, numerical modeling and/or developing new techniques for making biogeochemical and ecological observations across ocean eddies and fronts, you may be a good fit in the lab. Generally, we look for students who have a background in Physics, Engineering, Biology, Oceanography or a closely related area and have taken classes that might include: physics, biology, statistics, calculus, computer and/or data science. However, if you come from a non-traditional background, please don't let this list stop you from getting in touch. 

Prospective graduate students should apply to the [ODU Ocean and Earth science graduate program](https://www.odu.edu/oeas/academics/graduate). 

If you are interested in applying and think that our research sounds interesting, please [get in touch](mailto:sclayton@odu.edu). 

## Postdocs

If you are interested in joining the lab please contact me directly with your research interests.
